# Movie Recommendation using Content Filtering

## Description
This is a project that uses content filtering to recommend movies to users based on their preferences. Content filtering is a technique that analyzes the features of items and users, and finds the similarity between them. For example, if a user likes movies that are action-packed, sci-fi, and have a high rating, the system will recommend movies that have similar features.

The project uses Python and several libraries, such as pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, and matplotlib, to perform data analysis, feature extraction, similarity calculation, and visualization. The data set used for this project is the MovieLens 100K Dataset, which contains 100,000 ratings from 943 users on 1682 movies.

The project consists of the following steps:

- Data preprocessing: cleaning and transforming the data into a suitable format for analysis
- Feature extraction: extracting relevant features from the movie titles and genres
- Similarity calculation: computing the cosine similarity between movies based on their features
- Recommendation: generating a list of top 10 movies for a given user based on their ratings and preferences
- Evaluation: measuring the performance of the system using metrics such as precision, recall, and F1-score
- Visualization: plotting the distribution of ratings, genres, and similarities

## How to run the project
To run the project, you need to have Python 3 and the required libraries installed on your machine. You can use pip or conda to install the dependencies. You also need to download the data set from [this link](https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/100k/) and unzip it in the same folder as the code files.

To execute the code, you can use any Python IDE or run it from the command line. The main file is `project2.ipynb`, which contains all the functions and logic for the project. You can modify the parameters and variables in the file to change the input user, number of recommendations, similarity threshold, etc.
